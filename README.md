The purpose of this notebook is to build an NLP model to make reading medical abstracts easier.

The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05251) we're replicating.

## Introduction of paper
Over 50 million scholarly articles have been published (Jinha, 2010), and the number of articles published every year keeps increasing (Druss and Marcus, 2005; Larsen and Von Ins, 2010).

Approximately half of them are biomedical papers. While this repository of human knowledgeabounds with useful information that may unlock new, promising research directions or provide conclusive evidence about phenomena, it has become increasingly difficult to take advantage of all available information due to its sheer amount. Therefore, a technology that can assist a user to quickly locate the information of interest is highly desired, as it may reduce the time required to locate relevant information.

***When researchers search for previous literature,for example, they often skim through abstracts in order to quickly check whether the papers match their criteria of interest. This process is easier when abstracts are structured, i.e., the text in an abstract is divided into semantic headings such as `objective`, `method`, `result`, and `conclusion`. However, a significant portion of published paper abstracts is unstructured, which makes it more difficult to quickly access the information of interest. Therefore, classifying each sentence of an abstract to an appropriate heading can significantly reduce time to locate the desired information.***
